    "detail": "I went with my wife. Let me preface my report by saying I have major motion sickness, and was worried about my limitations on this trip. We stayed at the Polo Beach Condominiums, in #104. AMAZING. Easily the easiest access to the beach on the whole island. Like, 15 yards away. Our lanai, a couple steps of grass, and then the beach. Great views from living room and master bedroom. Best part of the trip."

    "detail": "I was in Guam P.I.C. with my company for a training for 3 days last weekend. My company put us in a nice hotel (P.I.C.) and treated us to nice restaurant. Guam is very beautiful. While most of my co-workers were busy shopping at K- mart and going crazy for GI, I found myself sitting on the beach gazing at the hotels on the beach. I realized I wasn't happy."
